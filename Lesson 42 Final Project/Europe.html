    <h3>Europe</h3>
    <div>
        <p>In two years, visiting Europe is going to get a bit more complicated for American travelers.
            <br>Starting in 2021, United States citizens will be required to undergo a pre-screening and registration
            process called the
            <br>European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) before entering European Schengen-zone
            countries.
        </p>
        <p> The Schengen area is comprised of 26 countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal
            and Spain.
            <br>Currently, Americans are allowed to travel visa-free to these countries for less than 90 days with no
            prior screening.
            <br>In a few years, there will be more to it.
            <br>Here's how the process works â€“ Each traveler must apply online, which includes filling out personal
            biometric questions
            <br>(name, date of birth, etc.), passport information as well as questions about the applicant's health,
            <br>criminal record and any previous European immigration history.
        </p>
        <p>Barcelona, Rome, and Amsterdam are among the three most visited cities in Europe.
            <br>These three cities have been welcoming tourists for decades.
            <br>Known for friendly and welcoming locals, who believed in providing true hospitality and
            <br>plenty of local experiences to equally grateful visitors.
        </p>
        <p> <br>However, this symbiotic relationship between tourists and locals is now under tremendous strain!
            Barcelona,
            <br>Rome, and Amsterdam are among an increasing number of European cities that are facing "Tourismphobia".
            <br>Overcrowding, mass-tourism, high cost of living, high property rents, mass commercialization is driving
            the locals angry,
            <br>who are now blaming the tourists for their problems. This summer (the peak tourist season!),
            <br>we would advise you to avoid some of these overcrowded, angry and protesting cities in Europe!</p>
